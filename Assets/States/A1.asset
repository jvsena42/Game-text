  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armered mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    At
    least 10 of them guarding the hanger door. Typical.



    Could try punching
    my way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.



    What should
    I do?



    1. Take them on - rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak my way to the
    emergency exit.'
